This tutorial will help you get started with a simply python web application that will allow you to write and query from amazon dynamodb

####In order to get started, you will first need two things:

1. An amazon web services account.
    1. If you don't already have an aws account, please create one [here](http://aws.amazon.com).

2. Once you've created your aws account you will need your `secret access key` and a `secret access id`
    1. these can be found in the following areas your aws management console.
        1. go to `Identity & Access Management`
        2. click on the `Delete your root access key` (we won't actually be deleting it)
        3. you will be taken to the `Your Security Credentials` where you will click on `Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)`
        4. Generate a new key and Store the generated `ID` and `Key` in a safe place.

####Once you have your keys you will need to store them in the project:

1. `cd` into the root directory of the project, and you will find a file called `secrets.py`

2. paste your `access_id`, and `secret key in their appropriate locations`

```
secrets.py

access_id = <your access ID>
secret_key = <your access key>


```

pip install virtualenv

pip install -r requirements.txt
